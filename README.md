## Problem Description:
The dataset contains information about patients with profound hypotension. The dataset includes the following columns:
- ID: Patient de-identified number
- anchor_age: Age of the patient (years)
- gender: F for female and M for male
- dod: Date of Death (if empty, the patient survived - patient outcome variable)
- apsiii: Severity of illness score
- LoS: Length of stay in ICU (days - patient outcome variable)
- charlson_comorbidity_index: Co-morbidity index
The goal is to find subgroups of patients that can have similar characteristics. This can be useful to predict the mortality rate and other outcomes of a new patient. 

## Problem Solution Overview:
The problem solution is divided into 3 parts:

- Part 1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Study and describe the main properties of the profound hypotension cohort using summary statistics and visualizations.

- Part 2: Clustering: Perform k-means clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Use the elbow method to determine an appropriate number of clusters. Select two different values of k for further analysis.

- Part 3: Interpretation: Analyze the main property differences between the clusters and investigate their relation to patient outcomes. Provide visualizations to support findings.

The details of the solution are present in the notebook.

## Files and Notebooks Required:
- COMP90089_assignment2_1363757_environment.yaml
- COMP90089_assignment2_1363757_notebook.ipynb
- hypotension_patients.csv

## Instructions to Recreate the Environment:
### Method 1:
- Ensure all the files mentioned above are in the same directory.
- Make sure Anaconda is installed on the system ([Download link](https://www.anaconda.com/download))
- Open Anaconda prompt. This is the Anaconda command-line interface.
- Execute this command: `conda env create -f COMP90089_assignment2_1363757_environment.yaml` 
    This will recreate the environment. It will take a couple of minutes to recreate the environment.
- Open Anaconda and then change the environment to 'Environment_1363757.'
- Launch Jupyter Notebook.
- Click on 'COMP90089_assignment2_1363757_notebook.ipynb' to open the notebook and execute the notebook.

### Method 2:
This method is the fallback method.
If there was an issue in creating the environment, open Anaconda, and in the default environment, manually install the core packages and versions. 

## Core Packages and Versions:
- Pandas version: 1.5.3
- Matplotlib version: 3.7.0
- Seaborn version: 0.12.2
- Scikit-learn version: 1.2.1
