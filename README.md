## Problem Description:
The dataset containing information about patients with profound hypotension. The dataset includes the following columns:
- ID: Patient de-identified number
- anchor_age: Age of the patient (years)
- gender: F for female and M for male
- dod: Date of Death (if empty, the patient survived - patient outcome variable)
- apsiii: Severity of illness score
- LoS: Length of stay in ICU (days - patient outcome variable)
- charlson_comorbidity_index: Co-morbidity index
The goal is to find subgroups of patients that can have similar charcteristics. This can be useful to predict the mortality rate and other outcomes of a new patient. 

## Problem Solution:
The probelem solution is devided into 3 parts:

- Part 1: EDA: Study and describe the main properties of the profound hypotension cohort using summary statistics and visualizations.

- Part 2: Clustering: Perform k-means clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Use the elbow method to determine an appropriate number of clusters. Select two different values of k for further analysis.

- Part 3: Interpretation: Analyze the main property differences between the clusters and investigate their relation to patient outcomes. Provide visualizations to support findings.
